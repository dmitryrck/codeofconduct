# Ruby New Zealand Code of Conduct

This code of conduct, or appropriate variations of it, applies to all Ruby New Zealand events, projects and related services.

It is based on the Geek Feminism community anti-harassment policy found here: [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy), and will be periodically updated to reflect any changes in the original version.
